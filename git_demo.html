            <p>I make the filling and then use a pie maker to finish the job. They are awesome. I have made a few variotions too, like add bacon and/or cheese. I ise puff pastry fot them as the short crust makes it taste like a dessert till the filling takes over. I know pies short be short crust on the bottom but unless ypu make your own, they taste a bot weird.</p>

            <p>Tasty & very easy to make but, personally, I will omit the tomato sauce when making again as I wasn't a fan. Sauce should be on the outside....but only if you want it which I never do.</p>
